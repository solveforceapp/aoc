# Logos Sequencer v1.0.0 - A Semantic Synthesizer

This is not a UI. This is a completed instrument. A 4-layer symbolic engine designed for the composition and exploration of meaning itself.

- **Geometry is alphabet.**
- **Phase is grammar.**
- **Field profiles are timbre.**
- **Vector fields are the acoustic chamber.**
- **The canvas is the oscilloscope.**
- **Trail paths are notation.**
- **Patterns are compositions.**
- **`activateModal` is the hammer hitting the string.**

## The Instrument Spine: A 4-Layer Architecture

The Logos Sequencer operates on a deterministic, four-layer pipeline. Every action flows through this coherent system, ensuring that geometry, timbre, motion, and rhythm remain distinct but interconnected.

### ① Semantic Layer
**`ModalKey → ModalConfig → ModalPhase → ModalGeometry`**

This layer defines **what** you pressed. It is the symbolic heart of the instrument, mapping a conceptual key to its fundamental geometric and phase properties.

### ② Interpretation Layer
**`resolveVectorFieldProfileId(cfg)`**

This layer defines **how it should sound**. It acts as the timbre engine, resolving a modal configuration into a specific Vector Field Profile, which dictates the visual dynamics of the field.

### ③ Motion Layer
**`computeFieldVelocity(nx,ny,profile)`**

This layer defines **how it moves**. It is the physics engine, calculating the vector velocities at every point on the canvas based on the selected profile, bringing the abstract timbre to life as dynamic motion.

### ④ Temporal Layer
**`playProgram(program, activateModal)`**

This layer defines **when it plays**. This is the sequencer and transport, allowing for the composition of `ModalKey` arrays into rhythmic, playable patterns called "etudes."

The entire system is driven by a single mechanical action: `activateModal(key)`. This is the "note-on" event. Everything else is its consequence.

## The Geometric-Dynamical Substrate

Beneath the conceptual layers of governance lies the physical reality of the instrument's field, governed by a triad of interconnected principles:

### Polygonomics — The Economy of Shapes
Polygonomics (*polygon + nomos*) governs the static geometry of the field. It dictates which primitives—polygons, polyhedra, rings, and shells—are allowed and how they are arranged. This forms the canvas upon which all dynamics occur. In the sequencer, this is expressed by the geometric figures derived from text length and dimension, creating a stable, structured space.

### Spinomics — The Economy of Rotation
Spinomics (*spin + nomos*) governs the temporal and cyclical dynamics of the field. It defines concepts of forward, retrograde, and cyclical motion, dictating how patterns and sequences traverse the geometric structures laid out by Polygonomics. The sequencer's playback modes (normal, loop, reverse) are a direct expression of Spinomic law.

### Vectonomics — The Economy of Flow
Vectonomics (*vector + nomos*) governs the moment-to-moment motion within the field. It is the physics engine, defining the properties of the vector field—direction, magnitude, curl, noise, and flow profiles (e.g., Grid, Orbit, Turbulent). It translates the abstract concepts of the active modal into tangible, visible motion, bringing the field to life.

## Canonical Etudes

The instrument ships with three canonical compositions, or "etudes," that define its core grammar.

- **Axiom Walk I**: A STRUCTURE etude, exploring the principles of coherence, integrity, and axiomatic primacy.
- **Cymatic Shells I**: An ENERGY etude, composing with concepts of resonance, synchronization, and regenerative geometry.
- **Lex Spiral I**: A LANGUAGE etude, weaving a path through attunement, glyphic code, and systemic linguistics.

## The Future: v1.1+ Evolution

The v1 architecture is a closed form. Future evolution will focus on additive composition and performance features without altering the instrument's spine.

- **Per-step Dynamics**: Introducing duration and emphasis controls for each step in a program.
- **Pattern Contours**: A "semantic atlas" to visualize the phase signature of each composition.
- **Advanced Transport**: Loop, ping-pong, and reverse playback modes.
- **UI Enhancements**: Ghost-trail previews on hover and a live playhead indicator.

The core is finished. Signed. Stamped. Playable.
